In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.

1) What are the number of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases in each Region.
2) In which region, maximum number of Confirmed cases were recorded?
3) In which region, minimum number of Deaths cases were recorded?
4) How many Confirmed, Deaths & Recovered cases were reported from India till 29 April 2020?
